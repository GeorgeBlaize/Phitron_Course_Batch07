An **if-else ladder** is a control structure used in programming to execute one block of code from multiple conditions. It checks conditions **sequentially from top to bottom**, and executes the block of the **first true condition**. If none are true, the `else` block is executed.

**Syntax (in C-style languages):**
```c
if (condition1) {
    // code block 1
}
else if (condition2) {
    // code block 2
}
else if (condition3) {
    // code block 3
}
else {
    // default code block
}
```

It helps handle **multiple decision paths** clearly and efficiently.
